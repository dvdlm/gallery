    <p>"circles are made from sinusoidal waves"... wrong answers only</p>
	<p>hover your mouse to shift the waves! </p>

    <p style="font-style: italic;max-width: 45em">dev notes: <br> an interesting glitch: for smooth motion, the actual wave position moves smoothly towards the target position (at your mouse). however, the mouse can move from PI to -PI when the mouse moves over the left side of the circle. smooth motion across this divide therefore tries to move "smoothly" between PI and -PI, but the path it takes is through the other direction. I can't figure out how to allow the angle to smoothly move through the overflow that comes so naturally to the angle-based system. Perhaps i need to make a coordinate system in an inherently infinite looping system then translate it to this polar (2 pi cycled angle based) system.</p>
